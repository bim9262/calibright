# With a focus on spell checking source code, most text will be in the form of
# identifiers that are made up of words conjoined via snake_case, CamelCase,
# etc. A typo at the word level might not be a typo as part of an identifier,
# so identifiers get checked and, if not in a dictionary, will then be split
#  into words to be checked.

# Identifiers are defined using unicode's XID_Continue which includes [a-zA-Z0-9_].

# Words are split from identifiers on case changes as well as breaks in [a-zA-Z]
# with a special case to handle acronyms. For example, First10HTMLTokens
# would be split as first, html, tokens.
